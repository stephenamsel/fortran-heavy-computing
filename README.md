# General Predictive Engine
This contains a modified version of an old Finite Elemet simulator. The long-term goal is for it to be combined with a N-body simulator, have several major upgrades, and be converted to a general-purpose predictive engine.

# Fortran MCMC Wrapper
This contains a wrapper within which a simulation of a complex system can be called. It applies Markov Chain Monte Carlo optimization to set input parameters for the simulation to produce outputs maximizing some quality-metric.
