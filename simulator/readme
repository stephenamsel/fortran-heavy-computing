This is an extension of the Paramesh FE simulator.

The first objective of this project is to replace the evolution module with a Crank-Nicholson or RK approach. The current approach is to use the HYPRE krylov-solver from LLNL for the implicit elements of those algorithms. That is expected to increase processing speed by well over an order of magnitude as evolution remains stable over larger time-steps.

The second objective is to generalize the data-structure to handle an arbitrary number of dimensions. The current approach is to use "wrapped" and "unwrapped" versions of each block. The "unwrapped" version runs through evolution while the "wrapped" version interacts with models. This is to allow simulation of arbitrary parameter spaces, physical and otherwise.

The third objective is currently private. Sorry, you'll just have to either join me in a private collaboration or wait for me to finish and publish the code.

The fourth objective is to create a user-friendly interface for model-input so that users need not know how to program in Fortran in order to input their models.
